I'm developing some plugins for the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/" target="_blank">SpigotMC</a> Minecraft server platform. <br/><br/>
A lot of them are libraries to make things easier for other developers with their plugins. But there are also some useful tools, minigames or even plugins which introduce completely new gameplay mechanics.
